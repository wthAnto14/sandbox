# ASCII Art Library in C

Welcome to the **ASCII Art Library**! This library is designed to provide simple utilities for generating and displaying ASCII art in C. Whether you're a developer looking to add some fun visual elements to your C projects or just want to explore creative ASCII art possibilities, this library offers you basic tools to get started.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key files:

- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project and how to use the library.
- **asciiart.h**: The core library file containing function definitions for creating and displaying ASCII art.
- **sample.c**: An example C program that demonstrates how to use the library to display ASCII art.
- **sample.sh**: A shell script to compile and run the example program using the ASCII art library.
- **.gitignore**: A configuration file that ensures unnecessary files, such as compiled objects or temporary build files, are not included in version control.

## Features

This ASCII art library includes the following features:
- Predefined ASCII art for common shapes (e.g., squares, triangles, circles).
- Functions to customize and display ASCII art with specified dimensions and characters.
- Basic drawing utilities for creating your own ASCII art patterns.
